# Spherical-Sandbox-Simulator
A spherical minecraft clone

In theory, the game will be centered around planets and sandbox building. Each layer of sphere will have a different classification and can be mined differently (similar to minecraft).


It might be a story game based on the fact the the planet is flat (or is it.... *dundundun*)
Sandbox easier modes are unlocked by playing the story (possibly)
